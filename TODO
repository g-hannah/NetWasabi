Correctly handle glob character in robots URL token rules

Concentrate all HTTP-related routines to http.c, which means getting rid of __handle301() from main(). However, in __handle301(), we
make a decision on whether to archive the old URL in order to avoid asking for it again in the future. We'll have to also build this
into the http.c file itself.

Create queue implementation and use several threads to consume URLs from buffers to create a "fast" option whereby we can get >1 URLs per second.
